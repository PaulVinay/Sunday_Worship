<h3>THE LIFE MEANING OF JESUS</h3>
<p>
Everything in His life, from His ministry to His Death, He did for us.
</p>

<h3>The Life and Mission of Jesus Christ</h3>

<p>Jesus Christ is the greatest being to be born 
on this earth our perfect example. He is Lord of lords, the Creator, our Savior, and He came to Earth so that we could live with God again.
</p>

<h4>Born in humble circumstances</h4>

<p>Jesus was born to the virgin Mary in a small village in a remote corner of the world. That humble birth fulfilled the hopes and dreams of all of us. He was the Son of God with infinite knowledge and power, yet He was also mortal and susceptible to hunger and pain. Jesus Christ fully experienced the challenges and sorrows of this life. He knows each of us and understands us perfectly.
</p>

<h4>Early Preparation</h4>
Even as a young man, Jesus was teaching the word of God. At 12 years old, He taught in the temple, and all that heard Him were astonished at His understanding. When Jesus began His ministry, He fasted in the wilderness for 40 days. He was tempted by the devil and overcame that temptation. He was also baptized in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. Although Jesus was without sin, He was still baptized by immersion in order to teach us obedience to God. After Jesus’s baptism, God declared, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:17).

<h4>Ministry</h4>
<p>Jesus healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, and even brought the dead back to life. More importantly, He made these miracles possible. Although His works were considered blasphemous behavior by the Jewish priests, Jesus continually reminded people that His works were aligned with God’s will so “that the Father may be glorified in the Son” (John 14:13).
</p>

<p>Jesus is also the perfect example of love. During His life on the earth, He cared for the poor, He healed the sick (see Luke 17:12–19), and He never turned away little children (see Matthew 19:13–14).
His love is endless and available to all of us.
</p>

<p>
Jesus taught that we must forgive. Even as He died on the cross, Jesus forgave the people who killed Him.
